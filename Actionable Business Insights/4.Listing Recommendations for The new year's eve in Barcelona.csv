Me apasiona el cine y la literatura y me encanta perderme por las calles de Barcelona, la ciudad que tanto amo.

Me gusta viajar y conocer otras culturas tan distintas y exóticas....lo único que me preocupa es que no se si tendré tiempo suficiente para visitar tanto mundo!!!!!

Soy responsable y trabajadora y me gusta que los nuevos amigos que se hospedan en nuestro apartamento disfruten de la estancia en él y del ocio y la cultura que Barcelona ofrece.

Comparto esta afición con mi padre y entre los dos intentamos que los viajeros se encuentren cómodos y se lleven un gran recuerdo de Barcelona y de nuestro apartamento.

Sed bienvenidos a mi casa. Autentico eixample ha sido mi hogar durante años. En la reforma mantuve  elementos originales del 1888 para conservar su espíritu barcelonés ... aunque las baldosas decoradas del baño las traje personalmente desde Estambul. Lo cambie por
el atico con gran terraza y vistas por una temporada, pero ahora la vida me ha llevado a un nuevo cambio de domicilio. 
Los dos apartamentos son muy agradables, espero os sintais en un hogar. El barrio tiene vida propia, disfrutad de ella y de las excelentes comunicaciones.
Mis amigos Pepe y Jepis me ayudan en la gestión del piso.
Pepe se ocupa de recibir a los huéspedes y hacer el check in/out. Jepis será vuestro contacto a través del chat de la web y será quien os informe sobre el piso, condiciones y otras informaciones que os puedan ayudar en la preparación de vuestro viaje. 
Será un placer ser vuestra anfitriona en Barcelona. Hablo francés e inglés y algo de alemán.
La construccion de la casa de L'Escala la promovió mi padre con un constructor en una antigua viña de su propiedad. El era nacido allí y desde 1970 ha sido mi casa de vacaciones. Grandes recuerdos asociados a ella! Mi amiga Flor os atenderà en cuanto necesiteis.

We have each lived in Barcelona for decades. We will gladly render advice on anything you might wish to do-whether it is holiday, touring, food or for your business-related travel needs. Our mission is to enhance (or simplify) our guests' experience in an way possible. You need only ask. In sum, we strive to provide a better experience than any five star hotel. That includes complete privacy, but a nicer, homier place to stay. If there is anything that we can do, share about living or working in BCN, please do not hesitate to ask. Our hosting style is to treat visitors as though they were good friends who have never been here, to maximize your time here. We are glad to organize anything that is of particular interest. If anything is less than perfect, we will run, possibly literally, to resolve it. Alternatively, if you prefer, we can have minimal contact, communicate in writing...or through your agent, manager or personal assistant: great. You're the guest. We will gladly share our favorite quirky haunts and eateries, things you might miss if you do not have access to an insider's view.
We love our home, neighborhood and our guests. The hosting experience: meeting new people, from all over, has been awesome.

The area sits on the right hand side of Passeig de Gràcia, the main boulevard that separates the city.  Its gridded layout keeps things nice and simple for walking around - most tourists flock to Gaudi’s emblematic Sagrada Familia church, but Eixample itself is a peaceful, residential neighbourhood that offers many an opportunity for a quite respite.  You could easily spend the day just popping in-and-out of the various artist galleries, small boutiques and neighbourhood cafes scattered about, that is if you can tear yourself away from the high-end shops that line the avenues.  To top it all off, Eixample is only two metro stops away from Placa Catalunya at the city centre.","https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/prohost-api/Hosting-17969324/original/0758a7f1-a57f-4beb-9458-27f38ec61db4.jpeg","32037490","https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/32037490","SweetInn","2015-04-27","Barcelona, Spain","Sweet Inn offers stylish and professionally designed apartments for both vacation and business trips.

It feels almost untouched by tourism, you rub shoulders with the locals everywhere - in terrace cafes, tapas bars and in the local pubs that permeate Gracia’s leafy squares and narrow streets.

My name is Enrique and I am a Barcelona Local. I have always loved traveling myself, but also sharing the beauty and wonders of Barcelona with others, so a few years ago I started renting out 2 apartments to travelers coming to the city, always meeting everyone in person so I could share my insights and hidden secrets about Barcelona :)

Now I rent out a few more apartments and it is no longer just me, but we are a small team of people managing the apartments together, but with the same focus on personal and attentive services in authentic apartments that allow for the genuine Barcelona feel for your trip! We call our little team Stay U-nique, because of this focus on a unique feeling when staying with us.

If you have any questions, want to hear about an apartment or just say hi, don´t hesitate to reach out :)

Have a great day!

My name is Enrique and I am a Barcelona Local.

My name is Enrique and I am a Barcelona Local. I have always loved traveling myself, but also sharing the beauty and wonders of Barcelona with others, so a few years ago I started renting out 2 apartments to travelers coming to the city, always meeting everyone in person so I could share my insights and hidden secrets about Barcelona :)

Now I rent out a few more apartments and it is no longer just me, but we are a small team of people managing the apartments together, but with the same focus on personal and attentive services in authentic apartments that allow for the genuine Barcelona feel for your trip! We call our little team Stay U-nique, because of this focus on a unique feeling when staying with us.

If you have any questions, want to hear about an apartment or just say hi, don´t hesitate to reach out :)

Have a great day!

I am passionate about travel and that is also what I do for a living; I rent out my own flat and other flats apart from building websites, my other passion-profession.. I let the daily management in the professional hands of my company Enjoy Apartments.

I go by the life motto that really runs for generations in my family which is: ""a day without having laughed isn't really a day..""

Looking forward to meet you, Ralph
