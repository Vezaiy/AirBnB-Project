AirBnB Data Engineering Project
Overview
This project presents a comprehensive data pipeline designed to process and analyze Airbnb data. The pipeline starts by importing CSV data into PostgreSQL, serving as a staging area. Using Python, the data is extracted from the staging area, transformed with the help of the Pandas library, and then loaded into a structured data warehouse in PostgreSQL. Finally, actionable business insights are derived from the processed data.

The data engineering pipeline is illustrated below:

Source System
Airbnb is a global online marketplace for short- and long-term accommodations and experiences. The platform connects hosts and guests, charging a commission on each booking. The data generated by Airbnb includes details about listings, bookings, reviews, host and guest profiles, pricing, availability calendars, and other operational metrics. This data is crucial for managing the marketplace, improving user experience, and supporting data-driven decision-making.

For a detailed breakdown of the data, refer to the Data Profiling section.

Data Warehouse Design
The project employs dimensional modeling to create a galaxy schema tailored to the business processes. The design process involves the following steps:

Business Process: The primary focus is on analyzing data to answer key business questions and support decision-making. Fact tables are designed to capture the outcomes of specific business processes.

Granularity:

Fact Tables: Data is stored at a daily level, with each row representing a specific listing on a specific date.

Dimension Tables: These tables aggregate data at various levels, such as summarizing metrics like price, number of reviews, and availability for each listing.

Dimensions:

Listing Dimension: Contains attributes related to listings, such as ID, name, description, host details, location, property type, room type, and amenities.

Date Dimension: Captures date-related attributes like date, month, year, and day of the week to analyze trends over time.

Facts:

Reservations Fact: Tracks data related to listing availability, pricing, and minimum/maximum stay requirements for each listing on specific dates.

Reviews Fact: Stores review-related data, including review ID, date, reviewer details, and comments.

ETL Process
The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process involves extracting data from the staging layer, converting it into pandas DataFrames, and performing transformations such as:

Removing leading and trailing whitespace from columns.

Adjusting column data types to align with the data warehouse schema.

Adding surrogate keys for unique identification.

Once transformed, the data is loaded into the data warehouse in PostgreSQL. The complete ETL process is documented in this Jupyter notebook.

Actionable Business Insights
The final step involves translating business questions into actionable insights. The project includes a set of queries and corresponding CSV files that provide answers to these questions. These insights can be found in the Actionable Business Insights folder.

This project demonstrates a robust data engineering workflow, from data ingestion to insightful analysis, enabling data-driven decision-making for Airbnb operations.
